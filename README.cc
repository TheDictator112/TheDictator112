This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (February 2015)

It is unclear when the convention of including a README file began, but examples dating to the mid-1970s have been found.[4][5][6][7][8][9][2][better source needed] Early Macintosh system software installed a Read Me on the Startup Disk, and README files commonly accompanied third-party software.

In particular, there is a long history of free software and open-source software including a README file; the GNU Coding Standards encourage including one to provide "a general overview of the package".[10]

Since the advent of the web as a de facto standard platform for software distribution, many software packages have moved (or occasionally, copied) some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to a website or wiki, sometimes including the README itself, or sometimes leaving behind only a brief README file without all of the information required by a new user of the software.

The popular source code hosting website GitHub strongly encourages the creation of a README file ‚Äì if one exists in the main (top-level) directory of a repository, it is automatically presented on the repository's front page. In addition to plain text, various other formats and file extensions are also supported,[11] and HTML conversion takes extensions into account ‚Äì in particular a README.md is treated as GitHub Flavored Markdown.


The expression "readme file" is also sometimes used generically, for other files with a similar purpose.[citation needed] For example, the source-code distributions of many free software packages (especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools) include a standard set of readme files:
